🧠 Data Science & Deep Learning Practice with Python Libraries
Welcome to Datascience.pr — a personal learning repository where I practice key concepts of Data Science and Deep Learning using Python. This project includes hands-on notebooks covering data preprocessing, exploration, machine learning basics, and deep learning models using real-world datasets like the Titanic dataset.

📌 Objectives
📊 Build a strong foundation in Python-based data science tools

🔍 Explore data using EDA and visualization techniques

🧹 Learn practical preprocessing methods (handling missing values, scaling, encoding, etc.)

🧪 Use machine learning libraries for classification and regression tasks

🤖 Explore deep learning concepts (ANN, CNN, RNN) with TensorFlow

🧰 Get comfortable with Jupyter Notebooks and GitHub workflow

🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
Library	Purpose
pandas	Data manipulation and cleaning
numpy	Numerical operations
matplotlib	Data visualization (basic plots)
seaborn	Statistical visualization
scikit-learn	Preprocessing and ML algorithms
tensorflow	Deep learning (ANN, CNN, RNN, model training)
