# 🧠 Data Science Practice with Python Libraries

Welcome to **Datascience.pr** — a personal learning repository where I practice key concepts of **Data Science** using **Python**. This project includes hands-on notebooks covering data preprocessing, exploration, and machine learning basics using real-world datasets like the Titanic dataset.
